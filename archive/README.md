# Archive

This directory contains the original scripts and setup files from before the repository reorganization.

## Structure

- **old_scripts/**: Original NIXL example scripts (nixl_gds_example.py, with_nxl_ucx.py, etc.)
- **old_setup/**: Original setup and installation scripts

These files are kept for reference but the new simplified benchmarks in the root directory should be used instead.

## What Changed

The repository was reorganized on 2025-11-03 to:
1. Move simple, robust benchmarks from `benchmarks/` to root
2. Archive old example scripts here
3. Make the repo structure cleaner and more focused

See the root README.md for current usage.
